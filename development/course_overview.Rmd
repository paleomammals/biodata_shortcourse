## Course Goals

When the environment changes, organisms can either move, adapt, or die out. Over the next three days, we’ll use the open source program R to analyze ecological and climatic data, explore how species’ geographic ranges shifted as climate changed in the past, and predict what might happen to them with future climate change.

Our specific goal is to introduce students to a data science approach to species conservation, especially the following:

- introduce the programming environment R
- learn how to clean messy data
- learn about common data used for species conservation (species occurrences) and an online tool that stores such data
- introduce the concept of 'species distribution modeling' and how it can be used to examine species range shifts through time.


## Instructors

### Dr. Jessica Blois
Jessica is a Professor of Biology and Environmental System Science at UC Merced. Her research focuses on how mammals and vegetation respond to environmental and climatic change in the  past, present, and future climate changes. She gets out into the field and hikes around the Sierra Nevada mountains looking for living small mammals (think squirrels, voles, mice, etc) and she also digs into the sediment in search of fossils - both animal remains as well as bits and pieces of past plant life. She teaches classes like "Fundamentals of Organismal Biology" and "Paleoecology" and loves to work with students at UC Merced.

## Schedule

### Logistics
We will work each day in COB1 281, following the overall Bobcat Summer STEM Academy schedule.

Each computer has a folder in the network drive, which is labeled with the class name ('Data Science for Nature and Conservation').  All files can be found here.

We will be using a program called R for our programming, with a graphical userface called "RStudio" that makes navigating R much easier. Each person has both R and RStudio installed on your computer, but you only really need to 'interact' with RStudio.
